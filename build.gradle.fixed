The provided `build.gradle.fixed` file contains the corrected dependency and version information.  The specific changes might vary depending on the original error, but common fixes involve:

1. **Resolving Dependency Conflicts:** Using appropriate version ranges or explicitly specifying versions for dependencies to avoid conflicts. For example, changing a dependency from `implementation 'com.example:library:1.0'` to `implementation 'com.example:library:1.0.0'` or a range `implementation 'com.example:library:1.0.+`.
2. **Updating Gradle and Build Tools:**  Updating Gradle version in the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file or the Android build tools version in the `build.gradle` file often fixes compatibility issues.  Refer to the Android documentation for the current recommended versions.
3. **Adding Missing Dependencies:** If a specific dependency is causing issues, ensure it is correctly included in `build.gradle`.
4. **Cleaning the project:** Running `./gradlew clean` can sometimes resolve transient issues.

Refer to `build.gradle.fixed` for a concrete example of the solution. Carefully compare it to the original `build.gradle` to understand the specific fixes.
