# Silent Android Build Failure in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when building Android APKs using Expo CLI. The build process fails without providing a clear error message, making debugging challenging.

The root cause is often an issue within the `android/app/build.gradle` file, involving dependency conflicts or version mismatches.  This repository provides both a problematic `build.gradle` and a corrected version. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `android` directory.
3. Attempt to build the project using Expo CLI (e.g., `expo build:android`). Observe the silent failure.
4. Replace `build.gradle` with `build.gradle.fixed` and attempt the build again. This time, the build should succeed.

## Solution

The solution typically involves carefully reviewing the dependencies and build tool versions within `android/app/build.gradle`.  Common causes include:

* **Conflicting dependencies:**  Check for dependency clashes and use version ranges to resolve conflicts. 
* **Incorrect build tool version:** Ensure that the build tools version is compatible with your project dependencies and Android SDK.
* **Missing dependencies:** Make sure all necessary dependencies are properly declared. 
* **Outdated dependencies:** Update to the latest stable versions of your project's dependencies. 

Debugging these silent failures requires careful examination of the build logs (often buried deep) and a methodical approach of resolving possible dependency issues.
