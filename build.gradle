This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The error message is vague, often just stating a general build failure without specific details. The underlying issue usually stems from misconfigurations within the `android/app/build.gradle` file, particularly concerning dependencies or build tools versions.  Incorrect configuration in the `app/build.gradle` file (e.g., mismatched dependencies, incorrect version numbers) can cause the Expo CLI build process to fail silently.
